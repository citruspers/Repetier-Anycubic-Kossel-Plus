Changelog Repetier 0.92 for Anycubic Kossel Plus

20180221

"I think it's actually done" edition
Implemented bed correction for much better first layers
Commented some values in configuration.h for better readability
Disabled endstop measurements during print (caused MANY failed prints due to EMI, but may break yoru printer if you're trying to print beyond your maximum Z-height)
Added full autolevel gcode script
Fixed encoder stepping (no more accidental doubleclicks)

Third version. Autoleveling now works AND stays within the printable area.
Just the simple 3-point level measurement for now, no depth-map because that's not supported in 0.92.

20170625

Second version
Basically changed the Delta rod parameters to get dimensionally accurate prints (at least to within 1 or 2 percent).
Milestone: printed a 20x20x20 test cube and measured it at x20.07, y19.96, z20.02.

Next up: bed leveling!
