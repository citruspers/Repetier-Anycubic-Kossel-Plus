Changelog Repetier 0.92 for Anycubic Kossel Plus

20170818
Modified delta rod length for better X and Y accuracy. Parts were printing ~2% too small despite my earlier calibrations, now a 20x20x20 cube is again printing at 19,96x20,00x20,2
Changed the bed level routine to 3 checks per tower for better averaged results
Changed the ABS quick settings to temperatures that suit PETG (I don't print ABS with this printer)
Changed the probe offset so I don't need a manual Z offset in Slic3r anymore (hopefully)

20170626

Third version. Autoleveling now works AND stays within the printable area.
Just the simple 3-point level measurement for now, no depth-map because that's not supported in 0.92.

20170625

Second version
Basically changed the Delta rod parameters to get dimensionally accurate prints (at least to within 1 or 2 percent).
Milestone: printed a 20x20x20 test cube and measured it at x20.07, y19.96, z20.02.

Next up: bed leveling!
